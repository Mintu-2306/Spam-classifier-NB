# Spam classifier NB
This project implements a spam message classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It classifies messages as 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam) based on their content. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled messages and is deployed as a web app using Streamlit, allowing users to input a message and receive a classification.
